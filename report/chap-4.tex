\chapter{Enhanced weight update\\}
\label{cha:Enhanced learning approach}
In order to improve the gradient based method displayed in Figure \ref{fig:basic learning} a new approach is suggested to calculate the update values of the different weights during the learning process. This new approach is based on...

%Next a new learning approach is proposed which is based on a fitting algorithm and makes use of taylor expansions.
