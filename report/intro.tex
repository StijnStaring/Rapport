\subsection{Importance of topic}
"Society expects autonomous vehicles to be held to a higher standard than human drivers." \cite{Prof.Amnon} This quote is setting the tone of the technology in autonomous driving. In order to be accepted to the public, autonomous vehicles should perform as least as good as the conventional human driver on parameters as for example safety. Despite widespread research on self-driving vehicles the acceptance by the user stays only limited.\cite{Bae2019} The purchase behaviour of customers can be directly linked with comfort. Also in order to gain more trust by the public it is clear that the challenge of making autonomous vehicles as comfortable as possible, should be tackled. This immediately leads to the questions what comfort during driving exactly is and how to measure it. A survey was conducted by researchers of the university of Warwick with as research question: Do passengers prefer autonomous vehicles be driven as full efficiency machines or in a way that emulates averaged human behaviour? \cite{UniversityofWarwick2019} The result suggested that a blend of both is appealing the most confidence by user of a autonomous vehicle.\\
Driving comfort is a personal experience and also depend on the current emotional state of the driver. This means that more than one driving style for autonomous vehicle-driving should be identified for a certain vehicle. \cite{Eindhoven2019} The state of the driver can be communicated with the vehicle at the start of each ride and different driving styles can be obtained by changing the parameters in the path planning algorithm.

\subsection{Link with previous studies and problem formulation}

In order to identify the specific comfort preferences of the driver that are quantized by these parameters, the vehicle should be able to learn them by demonstration. \cite{Kuderer2015a}\\
Despite that each driver has its own preferences, they are based on a common notion of comfort where only different trade-offs are made. For example some drivers prefer more aggressive driving behaviour than others which will manifests itself in a different trade-offs of different comfort criteria than for example a defensive drivers. This will later in this thesis be translated into a comfort objective where different weights are used in order to quantify different comfort trade-offs made. This approach is in literature called inverse optimal control because it is learning the objective function of the comfort optimization. The lower the outputted value of this comfort objective, the higher the measurement of attained comfort will be in the later path planning algorithm.\\

In order to find comfort criteria which can be used to distinguish different drivers, research about the common notion of comfort is necessary. Passenger surveys in public road transport about carsickness \cite{Turner1999} have identified lateral acceleration as the primarily responsible for motion sickness. It is explained that drive style is a main factor to influence the amount of sickness and it was found that sickness is higher when drivers drove with a higher average magnitude of fore-and-aft and lateral motion. These effect were found far more significant than the effect of vertical vibrations. There is also a consensus reached about the contribution of continuous trajectories to the prevention of motion sickness and the natural feel of paths.\cite{Elbanhawi2015} This means that higher order kinematic variables like accelerations and jerks also should be considered when measuring comfort.\\

\subsection{Thesis objective}
The goal of this thesis is to build further on the research of learning by demonstration \cite{Kuderer2015a} and to refine this idea in a good working practical application. The thesis is more concretely focussed in the ability to explain driver data and the practical implementation and validation of a learning algorithm that is able to capture user specific driving preferences in weights of a comfort objective function. The learning process is to be done offline and is based on an inverse optimal control approach. A comfort objective will be derived from literature to describe the common notion of comfort and this will be fitted on individual driver data to produce driver specific parameters. In the next step this objective function will be used in a path planning MPC formulation which will be calculating online feasible and comfortable paths whereafter an tracking MPC algorithm will follow it. \\

To conduct the inverse learning control there is first look at data generated by simulations where it is assumed that the vehicle is driving on an straight road and high way speed when executing manoeuvrers as lane changes and longitudinal accelerations. An example lane change can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:lane_change}. Assumptions made during this manoeuvre  To be able to make the generated data of high quality an MPC approach with a 15 degree of freedom vehicle model is used. Also in the learning algorithm itself a three degree of freedom non-linear bicycle model is used in order to adequately capture the different kinematic signals e.g. jerks and accelerations. Further there were comparisons made of different methods to learn from multiple datasets. \\

The execution of this research is conducted with the support of "Siemens Digital Industries Software - NVH R\&D engineering department" located in Leuven which made it possible to preserve the direct link with reality. Software was made available e.g. Simcenter Amesim and the possibility to validate the obtained algorithms with real driver data made it possible to make the results that could be obtained more significant.\\
